SODV3203 - Project Phase 0 Proposal
Group members: Ethan Wai, Michael Ng, Ka Kin Poon
Business / Name for your app: Recipe Sharing App

Proposal Overview: The Recipe Sharing App is designed to create a vibrant community where users can share and discover new recipes. This app will cater to food enthusiasts who enjoy cooking and exploring diverse cuisines. The app will feature a user-friendly interface that allows users to browse, submit, and comment on recipes, making it a valuable resource for both novice and experienced cooks.
Deciding on Features:

•	Recipe Feed Screen: This screen will display a list of user-submitted recipes with images and brief descriptions. Users can scroll through the feed to find interesting recipes. The feed will be dynamically updated to show the latest submissions, ensuring that users always have access to fresh content.

•	Recipe Detail Screen: When a user selects a recipe from the feed, they will be taken to a detailed view that includes step-by-step instructions, a list of ingredients, and user comments. This screen will also feature a rating system, allowing users to rate recipes and provide feedback.

•	Submit Recipe Screen: Users can submit their own recipes by filling out a form with the recipe title, description, ingredients, and instructions. They can also upload a photo of the dish. This screen will include validation to ensure that all required fields are completed before submission.

•	Local Data Persistence: The app will store user-submitted recipes and favorite recipes locally, ensuring that users can access their content offline. This feature will use a local database to save data, providing a seamless experience even without an internet connection.

•	Networked Connection: The app will fetch and post recipes to a shared database or API, allowing users to access a wide variety of recipes from other users. This will involve integrating with a backend service to handle data synchronization and ensure that the app remains up-to-date with the latest recipes.
